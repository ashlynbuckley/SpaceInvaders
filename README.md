# Space Invaders ðŸ‘¾ðŸ’¥
A replica of Space Invaders (1978) built in Java using JFrame!

## Overview
This program is a replica of Space Invaders, the arcade game, written in Java using JFrame.<br>
This was a project for my module Next Generation Technologies II: 2D Games Programming with indie game dev, Sam Redfern.<br>

***

You play as the green ship, defending your planet(?) from some very pixelated fleets of aliens! (Thank god you have a space gun with infinite bullets)<br>
It has both playing and "game over" states, with collision detection and "new wave"s implemented for each fleet killed.<br>
Also has smaller additional features like a score and highscore and sprite animation.

## Instructions
Download all the files in repo and open them in an IDE.<br>
Make sure image files are placed inside the project folder, a layer before src files.<br>
The code does not require you to add full local pathways!
